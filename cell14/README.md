# HTML CSS

### Create a web page that contain the following elements:

- A pink background (“Pink ? what’s wrong with pink ?”). Be cautious, this is not a random color choice.
- “Basics” as the navigation tab’s title.
- A title -so bigger- in white, centered, that contains at least 1 special character.
- Two images side by side representing online shops.
- Under each image, a link to the matching website.
- Under that, a horizontal line that separates the page (no matter the size of the window).
- Finally, under this line, aligned on the right side of the page, in italic and with a monospace font, the copyright symbol, your login, and the current year. (“© wil 2021”).

#### Note: this exercise should be consumed with moderation.
