# HTML CSS JS

#### For this exercise, you will blow a balloon.

To start, your HTML file will have a basic structure similar to the one seen in the introduction video. No library allowed.

Create in HTML/CSS a div 200px by 200px with a red background color. The bor- ders will be rounded to create a perfect round shape and not a square anymore. That div will then be our balloon.

When a click occurs on the balloon, its size will grow by 10px while keeping its round shape. With each click its color will go in that order from red to green, then blue and back to red again.

Usually, this type of balloon is rather resistant but if its size becomes greater than 420px it will explode and return to its original size.

Small additional detail, when the mouse is in the balloon and leaves it, the size of the balloon shrinks by 5px (the size of the balloon cannot go lower than 200px) and its color changes in the reverse order than mentioned earlier.
